# Security Fixes Complete - Multi-Tenant Isolation & Business Deletion

## Date: October 26, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the three critical security and operational fixes implemented to ensure proper multi-tenant data isolation and safe business management.

---

## ‚úÖ PRIORITY 1: WhatsApp Credential Sharing - FIXED

### Problem
Both "OneBillChat" and "hello@alacartesaas.com" businesses were using the SAME WhatsApp account credentials (phone_number_id: 440010785865257), causing a severe breakdown of multi-tenant isolation.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Disabled Duplicate WhatsApp Account
```sql
UPDATE whatsapp_accounts 
SET is_active = false, updated_at = now()
WHERE business_id = 'f98bf02c-80d6-4886-bbe0-0e8248d78c77'
  AND phone_number_id = '440010785865257';
```

**Result:** hello@alacartesaas.com can no longer send/receive WhatsApp messages through OneBillChat's account.

#### 2. Disabled Automatic WhatsApp Seeding
- Updated `supabase/functions/whatsapp-seed-from-secrets/index.ts`
- Function now returns "auto_seeding_disabled" instead of automatically creating WhatsApp accounts from environment secrets
- Existing logic preserved in comments for reference but will never execute

**Impact:**
- New businesses CANNOT automatically use shared WhatsApp credentials
- Each business MUST manually configure their own WhatsApp Business API account
- Prevents future credential sharing incidents

#### 3. Audit Log Entry Created
```sql
INSERT INTO business_audit_log (business_id, action, changed_by, changes)
VALUES (
  'f98bf02c-80d6-4886-bbe0-0e8248d78c77',
  'whatsapp_account_disabled',
  auth.uid(),
  jsonb_build_object(
    'reason', 'Duplicate WhatsApp credentials - security fix',
    'phone_number_id', '440010785865257',
    'timestamp', now()
  )
);
```

### Current State
- ‚úÖ OneBillChat has EXCLUSIVE access to WhatsApp (440010785865257)
- ‚úÖ hello@alacartesaas.com WhatsApp account disabled
- ‚úÖ No future businesses can auto-inherit WhatsApp credentials
- ‚úÖ Manual configuration required for all new WhatsApp connections

## ‚úÖ PRIORITY 2: Safe Business Deletion Function - IMPLEMENTED

### Problem
Deleting a business failed due to foreign key constraints with no cascade delete rules, specifically from the `training_conversations` table. This was actually GOOD (prevented accidental data loss) but made intentional deletion impossible.

### Solution Implemented

#### New Edge Function: `admin-delete-business`
- **Location:** `supabase/functions/admin-delete-business/index.ts`
- **Access:** Superadmin only (verified via user_roles table)
- **Authentication:** Requires JWT token with superadmin role

#### Features

1. **Preview Mode (confirm: false)**
   - Returns business details and counts of related records
   - Shows exactly what will be deleted
   - No actual deletion occurs
   - Requires explicit confirmation to proceed

2. **Deletion Mode (confirm: true)**
   - Deletes in correct dependency order:
     ```
     1. messages (29 for OneBillChat, 1 for hello@alacartesaas.com)
     2. conversations
     3. customers
     4. training_conversations (2 for hello@alacartesaas.com)
     5. whatsapp_accounts
     6. email_accounts
     7. ai_knowledge_documents
     8. voice_call_usage
     9. call_records
     10. business_users
     11. businesses
     ```
   - Logs each step to console
   - Creates audit log entry with full deletion summary

3. **Safety Features**
   - Requires superadmin role (server-side verification)
   - Two-step process (preview then confirm)
   - Comprehensive audit trail
   - Detailed error messages

#### Usage Example

**Step 1: Preview what will be deleted**
```javascript
const response = await supabase.functions.invoke('admin-delete-business', {
  body: {
    business_id: 'f98bf02c-80d6-4886-bbe0-0e8248d78c77',
    confirm: false
  }
});

// Returns:
{
  action: "preview",
  business: { name: "hello@alacartesaas.com", ... },
  counts: {
    customers: 4,
    conversations: 4,
    messages: 1,
    whatsapp_accounts: 1,
    email_accounts: 0,
    training_conversations: 2,
    business_users: 1,
    ai_knowledge_documents: 0,
    voice_call_usage: 0,
    call_records: 0
  },
  warning: "Set confirm: true to proceed with deletion. This action cannot be undone!"
}
```

**Step 2: Confirm and delete**
```javascript
const response = await supabase.functions.invoke('admin-delete-business', {
  body: {
    business_id: 'f98bf02c-80d6-4886-bbe0-0e8248d78c77',
    confirm: true
  }
});

// Returns:
{
  success: true,
  message: "Business 'hello@alacartesaas.com' and all related data deleted successfully",
  counts: { ... }
}
```

## ‚úÖ PRIORITY 3: RLS Policies for Voice Calling Tables - ADDED

### Problem
New voice calling tables had no Row-Level Security policies, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.

### Solution Implemented

Added RLS policies to 5 tables:

#### 1. voice_pricing_config
- **Superadmins can manage:** Full CRUD access
- **All users can view:** Read-only access for pricing information

#### 2. voice_call_usage
- **Business members can view their usage:** Filtered by business_id via business_users
- **System can insert/update:** Service role can log usage data
- **Superadmins can view all:** Full read access

#### 3. voice_credit_bundles
- **Everyone can view:** Public read access for bundle pricing
- **Superadmins can manage:** Full CRUD access

#### 4. call_records
- **Enhanced policy added:** OneBillChat users can manage their call records
- **Business isolation enforced:** Filtered by business_id
- **Superadmins have full access**

#### 5. call_queues
- **Existing RLS verified correct:** OneBillChat users can manage their queues

### Security Functions Used
All policies leverage the existing security definer functions:
- `has_role(auth.uid(), 'superadmin'::app_role)`
- `is_onebillchat_user()`
- `user_belongs_to_business(auth.uid(), business_id)`

## üìû Support

If you need to use the admin-delete-business function or have questions about these security fixes, contact the development team.

**Important:** The admin-delete-business function is ONLY accessible to superadmins. Regular users and business owners cannot delete businesses, even their own.
