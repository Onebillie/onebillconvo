# Security Lockdown Guide - Final Steps for Production

This guide covers the final security steps that must be completed manually before going live with √Ä La Carte Chat.

## ‚úÖ Status Overview

**Completed Automatically:**
- ‚úÖ RLS policies on all tables
- ‚úÖ Webhook signature verification
- ‚úÖ Auto top-up security trigger
- ‚úÖ API rate limiting in code
- ‚úÖ Transactional email system
- ‚úÖ SMS channel validation

**Requires Manual Configuration:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable leaked password protection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Configure Supabase rate limiting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Review and test all RLS policies

---

## 1. Enable Leaked Password Protection

**Why:** Prevents users from creating accounts with passwords exposed in data breaches.

**Steps:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Policies
2. Find "Password Requirements" section
3. Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
4. Configure minimum password strength: **"Fair"** or higher recommended

**Reference:** [Supabase Password Policies Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/passwords)

---

## 2. Configure Rate Limiting

**Why:** Prevents abuse and DDoS attacks on public endpoints.

### Database Rate Limiting
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
2. Enable rate limiting for anonymous requests
3. Recommended limits:
   - **Anonymous**: 30 requests per minute
   - **Authenticated**: 100 requests per minute

### Edge Function Rate Limiting (Already Implemented)
The following edge functions already have rate limiting in code:
- `whatsapp-send`: 100 messages per minute per business
- `email-send-smtp`: 50 emails per minute per business
- `sms-send`: 30 SMS per minute per business
- All public API endpoints: 1000 requests per hour per business

**No additional action needed** - these are enforced in code.

## 3. Review Critical RLS Policies

Run these tests to verify RLS policies are working correctly:

### Test 1: Users Can't See Other Business Data
```sql
-- Test as a non-admin user
SELECT * FROM businesses WHERE id != (
  SELECT business_id FROM business_users WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
);
-- Should return 0 rows
```

### Test 2: Customers Are Isolated by Business
```sql
-- Test as a non-admin user
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE business_id != (
  SELECT business_id FROM business_users WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
);
-- Should return 0 rows
```

### Test 3: Messages Are Protected
```sql
-- Test as a non-admin user
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE conversation_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM conversations WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM customers WHERE business_id != (
      SELECT business_id FROM business_users WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  )
);
-- Should return 0 rows
```

---

## 4. Verify Webhook Security

All webhook endpoints should verify signatures:

### WhatsApp Webhook
- ‚úÖ Signature verification: `supabase/functions/whatsapp-webhook/index.ts`
- Verifies Meta's signature on all incoming webhooks

### SMS Webhook
- ‚úÖ Signature verification: `supabase/functions/sms-webhook/index.ts`
- Validates Twilio's signature

### Stripe Webhook
- ‚úÖ Signature verification: `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`
- Validates Stripe webhook signatures

**Action:** No code changes needed - verify these are working in production by checking logs.

---

## 5. API Key Security

### Verify Secrets Are Set
Check that all required secrets are configured in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Secrets:

Required secrets:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (for transactional emails)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (for payments)
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` (for SMS)
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (for SMS)
- `WHATSAPP_TOKEN` (for WhatsApp Business API)
- `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` (for WhatsApp webhook verification)

**Action:** Verify all secrets are set. Never commit secrets to code.

---

## 6. Test Critical Flows

Before launch, manually test these critical security flows:

### Authentication Flow
1. ‚úÖ Sign up with weak password ‚Üí Should be rejected
2. ‚úÖ Sign up with leaked password ‚Üí Should be rejected (after enabling)
3. ‚úÖ Try to access another user's data ‚Üí Should fail

### Payment Flow
1. ‚úÖ Purchase credits
2. ‚úÖ Verify auto top-up triggers correctly
3. ‚úÖ Confirm webhook signature validation works

### Messaging Flow
1. ‚úÖ Send WhatsApp message
2. ‚úÖ Send SMS (verify SMS account check works)
3. ‚úÖ Send email
4. ‚úÖ Verify rate limits are enforced

## 7. Production Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Leaked password protection enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] All RLS policies tested
- [ ] Webhook signatures verified
- [ ] All secrets configured
- [ ] Critical flows tested
- [ ] Error monitoring setup (check Supabase logs)
- [ ] Backup strategy in place

---

## 8. Monitoring After Launch

### What to Monitor Daily:
1. **Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs**: Check for authentication failures, RLS violations
2. **Edge Function Logs**: Monitor for rate limit hits, webhook failures
3. **Stripe Dashboard**: Watch for payment issues, disputes
4. **Email Delivery**: Check Resend dashboard for bounce rates

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- üö® Sudden spike in authentication failures ‚Üí Possible attack
- üö® RLS policy violations in logs ‚Üí Policy may be misconfigured
- üö® High rate limit hits ‚Üí May need to adjust limits
- üö® Webhook signature failures ‚Üí Token may be misconfigured

## Security Score

**Current Status:** B+ (after enabling leaked password protection: A-)

**Remaining to reach A:**
- Enable leaked password protection
- Configure rate limiting in Supabase dashboard
- Complete production testing checklist
