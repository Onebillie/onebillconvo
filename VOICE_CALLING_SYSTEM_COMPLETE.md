## üìä Cost Calculation Example

**Scenario:** 5-minute Professional tier inbound call with recording

```
Twilio Costs:
- Call: 5 min √ó $0.0085 = $0.0425
- Recording: 5 min √ó $0.0025 = $0.0125
Total Twilio: $0.055 (5.5 cents)

Our Pricing:
- Call: 5 min √ó $0.02 = $0.10
- Recording: Included in Professional tier
Total Customer: $0.10 (10 cents)

Our Margin: 10 - 5.5 = 4.5 cents (45% margin)

Billing:
- Professional has 500 included minutes
- If current period usage < 500: No charge
- If current period usage > 500: Charge $0.10 to credits
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Navigate to Test Page:**
   ```
   /admin/voice-billing-test
   ```

2. **Test Pre-Call Check:**
   - Configure duration (e.g., 300 seconds = 5 minutes)
   - Select direction (inbound/outbound)
   - Click "Test Pre-Call Credit Check"
   - Verify: Allowed/blocked, cost estimate, remaining minutes

3. **Test Cost Calculation:**
   - Configure call parameters
   - Toggle recording/transcription
   - Click "Test Cost Calculation & Deduction"
   - Verify: Cost breakdown, margin calculation, credit deduction

4. **Test Usage Aggregation:**
   - Click "Test Usage Aggregation"
   - Check logs for aggregation results
   - Verify voice_call_usage table has new entries

5. **Test Credit Purchase:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Subscription ‚Üí Voice Calling Usage
   - Click "Buy Credits"
   - Select bundle
   - Complete Stripe checkout (use test card)
   - Verify minutes added to voice_credit_balance

### Automated Testing

**Database Queries:**
```sql
-- Check pricing config
SELECT * FROM voice_pricing_config WHERE is_active = true;

-- Check recent usage
SELECT * FROM voice_call_usage 
WHERE created_at > now() - interval '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check credit bundles
SELECT * FROM voice_credit_bundles WHERE is_active = true;

-- Check business voice credits
SELECT id, name, voice_credit_balance, voice_minutes_used_period 
FROM businesses 
WHERE voice_credit_balance IS NOT NULL;
```

**Edge Function Logs:**
- Monitor `/admin` ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Logs
- Look for: calculate-call-cost, deduct-call-credits, aggregate-voice-usage

---

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **API Authentication:**
   - All edge functions use service role key for database operations
   - API endpoints require valid API key
   - Pre-call checks verify business ownership

2. **Credit Manipulation Prevention:**
   - Only edge functions can modify voice_credit_balance
   - All deductions are logged in voice_call_usage
   - Audit trail maintained in call_records

3. **Cost Calculation Integrity:**
   - Twilio costs stored separately for verification
   - Margin calculation is transparent
   - All pricing configuration in database (auditable)
