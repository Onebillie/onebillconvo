## RB-001: Account Frozen Due to Payment Failure

### Symptoms
- Customer reports "Account Frozen" banner
- Cannot send messages
- Can receive but not reply

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify Account Status**
```sql
SELECT id, name, is_frozen, stripe_customer_id, subscription_status
FROM businesses 
WHERE id = 'BUSINESS_ID';
```

2. **Check Stripe Payment Status**
- Go to Stripe Dashboard
- Search for customer ID
- View invoice history
- Check last payment status

3. **Check Outstanding Invoice**
```sql
SELECT * FROM invoices 
WHERE business_id = 'BUSINESS_ID' 
  AND status = 'failed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Resolution Steps

**If payment genuinely failed:**
1. Contact customer: "Your payment failed. Please update your payment method."
2. Send payment link via email
3. Wait for payment to process
4. Webhook will auto-unfreeze account

**If payment succeeded but account still frozen:**
1. Manually unfreeze account:
```sql
UPDATE businesses 
SET is_frozen = false,
    frozen_at = NULL,
    frozen_reason = NULL
WHERE id = 'BUSINESS_ID';
```

2. Check webhook logs:
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ stripe-webhook â†’ Logs
# Look for invoice.payment_succeeded event
```

3. If webhook missed, manually trigger unfreezing:
   - Run SQL above
   - Send confirmation email to customer

### Prevention
- Monitor webhook delivery success rate
- Set up retry logic with dead-letter queue
- Alert on webhook failures

---

## RB-002: Message Delivery Failures (Bulk)

### Symptoms
- Multiple failed messages across different conversations
- Messages stuck in "sending" status
- Customer reports messages not going through

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Message Failure Rate**
```sql
SELECT 
  channel,
  COUNT(*) as total_messages,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'failed') as failed_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'failed')::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as failure_rate
FROM messages
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY channel
ORDER BY failure_rate DESC;
```

2. **Identify Affected Channel**
- If WhatsApp: Check Meta API status
- If Email: Check SMTP connection
- If SMS: Check Twilio status

3. **Check Provider Status**
- WhatsApp: https://developers.facebook.com/status/
- Twilio: https://status.twilio.com/
- Email: Check Resend/SMTP provider status

### Resolution Steps

**If provider is down:**
1. Acknowledge incident
2. Update status page (if you have one)
3. Wait for provider recovery
4. Messages will retry automatically

**If provider is up:**
1. Check recent code deploys:
```bash
# Check git log for recent changes to send functions
git log --since="2 hours ago" -- supabase/functions/*send*
```

2. Check edge function logs:
```bash
# Supabase Dashboard â†’ Functions â†’ whatsapp-send/email-send-smtp/sms-send â†’ Logs
# Look for error patterns
```

3. **Common issues:**
   - **Rate limit exceeded:** Throttle sending, increase delay
   - **Invalid credentials:** Verify secrets in Supabase
   - **Malformed payload:** Check message validation

4. **Quick fix rollback:**
```bash
# If recent deploy caused it, rollback edge functions
git revert <commit_hash>
git push
```

### Prevention
- Monitor delivery success rate per channel
- Set up alerts at 5% failure rate
- Implement circuit breaker pattern

---

## RB-003: WhatsApp Webhook Down/Failing

### Symptoms
- WhatsApp messages not appearing in inbox
- Delivery status not updating
- Webhook signature errors in logs

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Webhook Endpoint Status**
```bash
curl -X POST https://jrtlrnfdqfkjlkpfirzr.supabase.co/functions/v1/whatsapp-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'
```

Expected: 200 OK or proper error message

2. **Check Edge Function Logs**
```bash
# Supabase Dashboard â†’ Functions â†’ whatsapp-webhook â†’ Logs
# Look for:
# - Signature verification failures
# - Timeout errors
# - 500 Internal Server Errors
```

3. **Verify Webhook Token**
```sql
SELECT value FROM secrets WHERE name = 'WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN';
```

### Resolution Steps

**If signature verification failing:**
1. Check WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN in Supabase matches Meta
2. Go to Meta â†’ WhatsApp â†’ Configuration â†’ Verify Token
3. If mismatch, update Meta side (don't change secret)

**If webhook timing out:**
1. Check database connection pool:
```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
```

2. If > 80% of max connections, investigate slow queries
3. Restart connections if needed

**If webhook returning 500:**
1. Check error in logs
2. Fix code issue
3. Deploy fix
4. Test with Meta webhook test button

### Recovery

1. **Replay missed webhooks:**
   - Unfortunately, Meta doesn't replay
   - Manually sync recent messages:
```sql
-- Check for gaps in message timestamps
SELECT conversation_id, 
       MAX(created_at) as last_message,
       NOW() - MAX(created_at) as time_since_last
FROM messages
WHERE channel = 'whatsapp'
GROUP BY conversation_id
HAVING NOW() - MAX(created_at) > INTERVAL '30 minutes'
ORDER BY time_since_last DESC;
```

2. Contact affected businesses, ask them to manually check WhatsApp

### Prevention
- Monitor webhook success rate
- Alert on >5% failure rate
- Implement webhook retry queue

---

## RB-004: Database High CPU (>80%)

### Symptoms
- Slow dashboard loading
- Queries timing out
- High database CPU alert

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Current CPU Usage**
```bash
# Supabase Dashboard â†’ Database â†’ Performance
# Look at CPU graph
```

2. **Find Slow Queries**
```sql
SELECT 
  pid,
  usename,
  application_name,
  state,
  query_start,
  NOW() - query_start AS duration,
  LEFT(query, 100) AS query_snippet
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle'
  AND query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_activity%'
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

3. **Check for Missing Indexes**
```sql
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  seq_scan,
  idx_scan,
  seq_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE seq_scan > 1000
  AND idx_scan < seq_scan
ORDER BY seq_scan DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Resolution Steps

**Immediate mitigation:**
1. **Kill long-running query (if safe):**
```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE pid = <PROBLEMATIC_PID>;
```

2. **Add temporary rate limiting:**
   - Reduce edge function concurrency
   - Add request queuing

**Long-term fix:**
1. **Add missing indexes:**
```sql
-- Example: If messages table doing sequential scans
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_messages_conversation_created 
ON messages (conversation_id, created_at DESC);
```

2. **Optimize query:**
   - Add WHERE clauses to reduce scan size
   - Use LIMIT on large result sets
   - Add pagination

3. **Scale database:**
   - Upgrade to larger instance in Supabase
   - Enable read replicas if available

### Prevention
- Monitor slow query log daily
- Review database performance weekly
- Proactively add indexes for common queries

# Update STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

3. Test webhook:
```bash
# Stripe Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ Webhooks â†’ Send test webhook
```

**If webhook URL incorrect:**
1. Verify endpoint:
```
https://jrtlrnfdqfkjlkpfirzr.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
```

2. Update in Stripe if wrong

3. Re-send failed events:
   - Stripe Dashboard â†’ Developers â†’ Webhooks â†’ Failed Events
   - Click "Resend" on each failed event

### Recovery

**Manually sync subscription status:**
```sql
-- For each affected business, manually update from Stripe
UPDATE businesses
SET subscription_tier = 'starter',  -- Get from Stripe
    subscription_status = 'active',
    subscription_period_end = '2025-02-01'  -- Get from Stripe
WHERE stripe_customer_id = 'cus_...';  -- Customer ID from Stripe
```

### Prevention
- Monitor webhook success rate
- Alert on signature failures
- Implement webhook event replay queue

```sql
UPDATE businesses
SET 
  credit_balance = credit_balance + 500,  -- Amount purchased
  credit_balance_updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'BUSINESS_ID';
```

2. Log manual adjustment:
```sql
INSERT INTO audit_logs (
  business_id,
  action,
  details,
  performed_by
) VALUES (
  'BUSINESS_ID',
  'manual_credit_addition',
  'Added 500 credits due to missed webhook',
  auth.uid()
);
```

**If credits deducted incorrectly:**
1. Check overage pricing in `stripeConfig.ts`
2. Recalculate correct cost
3. Refund difference:
```sql
UPDATE businesses
SET credit_balance = credit_balance + <REFUND_AMOUNT>
WHERE id = 'BUSINESS_ID';
```

SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

2. Close idle connections:
```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'idle'
  AND state_change < NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';
```

**If third-party API down:**
1. Implement circuit breaker
2. Return cached data if available
3. Queue requests for retry

### Prevention
- Implement gradual rollouts
- Add smoke tests before deploy
- Monitor error rate per function
- Set up automated rollback

## RB-015: Storage Quota Exceeded

### Symptoms
- File upload failures
- "Storage quota exceeded" errors
- Images not loading

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Storage Usage**
```sql
SELECT 
  bucket_id,
  COUNT(*) as file_count,
  SUM(size) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 as size_gb
FROM storage.objects
GROUP BY bucket_id
ORDER BY size_gb DESC;
```

2. **Check Supabase Quota**
- Supabase Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Billing
- View storage usage vs quota

3. **Identify Large Files**
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  bucket_id,
  size / 1024 / 1024 as size_mb,
  created_at
FROM storage.objects
ORDER BY size DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Resolution Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Upgrade Supabase plan if possible
2. Block new uploads temporarily:
```sql
-- Add size check to upload function
IF (SELECT SUM(size) FROM storage.objects) > QUOTA_LIMIT THEN
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'Storage quota exceeded';
END IF;
```

**Long-term:**
1. Implement file cleanup policy:
```sql
-- Delete files older than 90 days from temp uploads
DELETE FROM storage.objects
WHERE bucket_id = 'temp-uploads'
  AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

2. Compress images on upload
3. Move old files to cheaper storage (S3 Glacier)

### Prevention
- Monitor storage usage daily
- Alert at 80% quota
- Implement file retention policy
- Compress media on upload
